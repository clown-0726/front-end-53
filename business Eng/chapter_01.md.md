24. Let’s `walk the board` this morning:
- I am feeling under the weather
- I am still down with flu.
- February was another `release-filled` month.
- I’d like to take tomorrow off `if there are no objections`.
- I’m excited to hear how it goes.
- You all `have done` a really great job.
- Shadow DOM removes the `brittleness` of building web apps. The brittleness comes from the global nature of HTML, CSS, and JS. Over the years we've invented an `exorbitant` number of tools to `circumvent` the issues. For example, when you use a new HTML id/class, `there's no telling` if it will conflict with an existing name used by the page. `Subtle bugs creep up`, CSS specificity becomes a huge issue (!important all the things!), style selectors grow out of control, and performance can suffer. The list goes on.
- hello....`stepping away` for 1 min! thx
