31. Shadow DOM removes the `brittleness` of building web apps. The brittleness comes from the global nature of HTML, CSS, and JS. Over the years we've invented an `exorbitant` number of tools to `circumvent` the issues. For example, when you use a new HTML id/class, `there's no telling` if it will conflict with an existing name used by the page. `Subtle bugs creep up`, CSS specificity becomes a huge issue (!important all the things!), style selectors grow out of control, and performance can suffer. The list goes on.
